# Drug-activity-prediction
Developed and implemented a deep neural network (DNN) based model to predict the results of a quan-titative structure activity study (QSAR) of potential drug candidates.
Implemented a genetic algorithm(GA) based approach that reduced the computational time by 30% and improved the prediction accuracyby 5%
